# ttlcpu

    Toolchain created to build programs for the
    'ttl-cpu' (http://digitarworld.uw.hu/ttlcpu.html)
    
    The toolchain contains:
    
     -  'mcc' A compiler which resembles to 'C' and implements
        a subset of the 'C' programming language
    
     -  'am' A very basic assembler implemented by using the
        capabilities of the gnu-gcc preprocessor
    
     -  'burner' Program that transfers assembled bytecode to
        the 'ttl-cpu' from an ATmega8 mcu

To build a program, first edit 'prog.c' then run './b' shell script
